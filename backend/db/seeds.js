The Big Bad Wolf is a fictional wolf appearing in several cautionary tales that include some of Aesop\'s Fables (c. 600 BC) and Grimms\' Fairy Tales. Versions of this character have appeared in numerous works, and it has become a generic archetype of a menacing predatory antagonist for Granny and Red Riding Hood. As for the protagonist herself, "Little Red Riding Hood" is of European origins and can be traced back to the 10th century to several European folk tales, including one from Italy called The False Grandmother, later written among others by Italo Calvino in the Italian Folktales collection; the best known versions were written by Charles Perrault and the Brothers Grimm. With several incarnations in plays and on the big screen, the big bad wolf is definately one to watch out for! He\'s had a big presence in the legends of red riding hood and in popular culture. A more recent portrayal was made by none other than Johnny Depp in Disney\'s \'Into the Woods\' back in 2014',
