# Disney's Villains -FIRST MERN STACK PROJECT

## Overview

This was a GA homework and side project I was playing around with using the MERN stack. A website that allows users to read up on the history of some of Disney;'s famous Villains- a rest API built by myself. The user can register and login using user authentication, and submit their own villains- images and information about other villains and leave comments on articles.  The project included authentication and restful API integration.
